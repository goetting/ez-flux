# ezFlux (WIP)

ezFlux is a tiny, simple JavaScript state machine with flux-like event flow.
It extends its only dependency: EventEmitter3.
Its single state can only be manipulated by actions.
If enabled, it generates a comprehensive timeline documenting all state changes.

No dispatchers, no reducers, no stores.
Only user actions, transparent events and one enumberable state.

### Usage
EZFlux expects a dictionary of state-namespaces with values and actions.
The return value of actions will be Object.assigned to the values of the state-namespace.

```JS
import EZFlux from 'ez-flux';

const ezFlux = new EZFlux({
  weather: {
    values: {
      rain: false
    },
    actions: {
      setRain: rain => ({ rain })
    },
  },
});
```


ezFlux will assemble the state and generate action triggers for the appropriate actions.

```JS
ezFlux.state;
// Implicit getter returns deepClone of state: { weather: { rain: false } }

ezFlux.on('change:state.weather', () => console.log(ezFlux.state.weather) );
// Full event emitter API - subscribe to changes on the 'weather' namespace of the state

ezFlux.actions.weather.setRain(true);
// Triggers our action. Our listener will now log: { rain: true };
```

ezFlux also supports asynchronous behaviour. An action may be an async function, potentially acceping a promise as a return value.

```JS
import EZFlux from 'ez-flux';

const ezFlux = new EZFlux({
  weather: {
    values: {
      rain: false,
      temperature: '0 Â°C',
    },
    actions: {
      setRain: rain => ({ rain }),
      loadData: async (query) => {
        const { temperature, rain } = await apiCall(query);

        return { temperature, rain };
      },
    },
  },
});
```

All actions return promises. In simple situations, this can be helpful if you wish to avoid helper values like "isLoading" on your state.

```JS
aync function renderCityWeather(city) {
  await ezFlux.actions.weather.loadData({ city });
  const { weather } = ezFlux.state;

  renderData(weather);
}
```
You may freely use this behavour to orchestrate more complex workflows.
The ezFlux will still emit the propper events for actions triggered and states changed to anyone subscribed.

### Development

To run Linter, Flow, Bable and Jest and have them watch src and test folders respectively:
```sh
$ npm start
```

To run Babel once:
```sh
$ npm run build
```
To autofix eslint issues

```sh
$ npm eslint:fix
```
To generate test coverage report:

```sh
$ npm run test:coverage
```
